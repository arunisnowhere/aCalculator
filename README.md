The vision to create a math gui calculator for different calculations and functions (and more?), as a part of learning python programming. This also is in line with my general interest in math and my ongoing studies.

Note: This will probably be no different from other available calculators. The aim is to learn and to have fun, no more no less.

Development vision is as follows:

(1) Create a bunch of different python functions for various operations such as factorial, root, etc.

(2) Convert functions into modules.

(3) Use classes and objects.

(4) Make GUI.
